Inode : The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object
such as a file or a directory.
Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data.

File-system object attributes may include metadata (times of last change,access, modification), 
as well as owner and permission data.
